# Fashion Image Classification

## Overview
The project aims to enhance the accuracy and stability of fashion item identification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by incorporating early stopping regularization techniques. By addressing overfitting issues and improving model generalization, the project seeks to create more reliable and robust fashion classification systems. This project involves a comparative analysis of the performance of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models with and without Early Stopping Regularization in the context of fashion item identification. 

## Background and Motivation
Fashion item identification and classification have become essential tasks in various applications, including e-commerce, social media, and visual search engines. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in image classification tasks, including fashion items recognition. However, CNNs are prone to overfitting, where the model learns to memorize the training data instead of generalizing patterns, leading to reduced performance on unseen data.

Early stopping is a regularization technique commonly used in training neural networks to prevent overfitting. It involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training and stopping the training process when the validation performance starts deteriorating, thus preventing the model from overfitting the training data.

The motivation behind this project stems from the need to develop more reliable and accurate fashion classification systems. Traditional CNN models trained without regularization techniques often suffer from overfitting, leading to decreased performance in real-world scenarios. 

## Goals
By integrating early stopping regularization into the training process, the project aims to:
1. Improve Model Generalization
2. Enhance Model Stability
3. Boost Classification Accuracy
